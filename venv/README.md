# **Weather Application**

A comprehensive, user-friendly Python-based command-line application that provides real-time weather information and a 5-day weather forecast for any city. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data, and includes functionality to save weather data to a local file.

---

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Weather:** Get up-to-date weather data for any location worldwide.
- **5-Day Forecast:** View detailed weather predictions for the next 5 days.
- **Save to File:** Easily save the current weather data to a `.txt` file for future reference.
- **Simple and Elegant Interface:** Command-line interface with color-coded output for clarity and enhanced user experience.
- **Customizable Temperature Units:** Switch between Metric (Celsius) and Imperial (Fahrenheit) units.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- The following Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `tabulate`
  - `colorama`
  - `python-dotenv`

You can install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install requests tabulate colorama python-dotenv
```

---

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository or download the source code.**
2. **Obtain an API key** from [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).
3. **Create a `.env` file** in the project directory and add your API key:

    ```
    API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
    ```

4. **Run the application** by executing the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    python weather_app.py
    ```

---

## **Usage Guide**

### **Starting the Application:**

- Upon running the script, you'll be prompted to **enter the city name** for which you want weather data.
  
### **Unit Selection:**

- Choose between **Metric (Celsius)** or **Imperial (Fahrenheit)** units for temperature measurements.

### **Weather Options:**

- Choose between:
  - **Current Weather**: Displays temperature, wind speed, humidity, and more.
  - **5-Day Forecast**: Displays the forecast for the next 5 days, including temperature and weather descriptions for each time interval.

### **Save Data to a File:**

- After fetching the current weather, you will have the option to save the data in a `.txt` file for future use.

---

## **Error Handling**

- **Invalid City**: Displays an error if the city name is incorrect or not found.
- **Network Issues**: The app handles timeouts or connection errors gracefully, providing user-friendly error messages.
- **API Key Missing**: Prompts an error if the API key is missing from the `.env` file.

## **Converting to a Standalone Executable**

To convert this application to a standalone executable using **PyInstaller**, follow these steps:

### **1. Install PyInstaller:**

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### **2. Add an Icon:**

To include a custom icon for the executable, ensure you have an `.ico` file prepared. The icon should be professional, and relevant to the application, like a weather icon.

### **3. Create the Executable:**

Run the following command to bundle your Python script into a single executable file, including the custom icon:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --icon=weather_icon.ico weather.py
```

- The `--onefile` flag creates a standalone executable.
- The `--icon` flag allows you to specify an `.ico` file as the icon for the executable. Replace `weather_icon.ico` with the path to your icon file.

### **4. Locate the Executable:**

After the conversion, the executable will be located in the `dist` directory generated by PyInstaller.

---

## **Important Considerations**

- **API Limits**: OpenWeatherMap's free API tier has a rate limit. Be mindful of this if making frequent requests.
- **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file must be in the same directory as the executable for the API key to be properly loaded.
